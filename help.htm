<h1>Dictutorial Help</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Dictutorial is a dictating tutor application, designed to improve your ability to read, speak and type native and foreign language texts. Here are a few skills it will help you to develop:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dictation</strong>: typing words as they are spoken</li>
<li><strong>Reading and pronunciation</strong>: in a first or second language</li>
<li><strong>Translation</strong>: between two languages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Source Material</h2>
<p>You can add text or html files as source material for reading and reciting. There are two ways to do this:</li>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the file into the book container. For example, in Windows you would do the following:</li>
	<ol>
	<li>Open Windows Explorer and orientate it so you can see its window and the book container at the same time.</li>
	<li>Select the file.</li>
	<li>With the left mouse button still pressed, or with you finger still on the touch screen, drag the file across to the book container and release.
	</ol>
<li>Double-click the book container or press the <strong>Choose file</strong> button. This opens the <strong>File Open</strong> dialog, with which you can navigate to and select the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have selected the file, its contents will appear in the book container. You will notice a <strong>Clear</strong> button appears above the container to the right of the file name. Press this to empty the container, ready to import a different file.</p>
<h3>Recommended Book Sources</h3>
<p>The excellent, long-standing <a href="www.gutenberg.org" target="_blank">Project Gutenberg</a> web site has just about every book in the public domain, available in html and text formats which you can download and import into Dictutorial. Here are a few links that you can right-click to download texts for bilingual use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marcel Proust: <a href="www.gutenberg.org/files/2650/2650-0.txt">Du côté de chez Swann (French)</a>, <a href="www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7178.txt.utf-8">Swann's Way (English)</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Note: You may want to edit the downloaded text to strip out the start and end matter. Also, you may need to edit texts when using them bilingually, so that their sentences stay synched during reading.</p>
<h2 id="options">Options Panel</h2>
<p>In the top-left of the window, you will see the <strong>Options</strong> button. To display the options panel, either:
<ul><li>hover the mouse pointer over the <strong>Options</strong> button, or</li>
<li>on a touchscreen device, tap the <strong>Options</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>The panel closes when you move the mouse pointer beyond the panel borders or tap anywhere outside the panel.</p>
</ul>
<p>The panel presents the following controls.</p>
<h4>Voice 1, 2</h4>
<p>Select the voice you want used for book 1 and, for bilingual tasks, book 2. Normally you would want to make this appropriate to the language of the text, unless you wish to train your ear to better understand your native language in foreign accents.</p>
<h4>Mode</h4>
<p>Select <strong>dictation</strong> if you want to be tested on your ability to type the words you hear, or <strong>reading</strong> if you just want to listen to or follow the text as it is read out aloud.<p>
<h4>Highlight</h4>
<p>Determines whether the section of text currently being read is highlighted in the book container.</p>
<h4>Require accents</h4>
<p>This option is only available in dictation mode. It determines whether properly accented characters, such as é (e-acute) must be entered for your input to be marked as correct. If you leave this check box clear, then you can enter unaccented or accented characters as you wish, so that the letter e is treated the same as e-grave or e-acute.</p>
<h4>Hide text</h4>
<p>This option is only available in dictation mode. It determines whether the source text is visible before you enter the words you hear. Keeping it ticked enables you to refer to the text if you have trouble understanding what's being said.</p>
<h4>Advance by</h4>
<p>These options specify the blocks by which text advances as it is spoken: by word, by phrase or by sentence. Selecting <strong>bilingual</strong> creates a second book container into which you can import a translation of the text shown in the first container. Bilingual texts always advance by sentence, alternating between the two books.</p>
<h2>Taking a dictation test</h2>
<p>A dictation exercise involves your listening to spoken text and accurately typing the words you hear. The skill of taking dictation, transcribing spoken text, is an important language skill, demonstrating not only the ability to identify and spell the words in speech, but also to remember large chunks of text for as long as it takes to convert them to written text.</p>
<p>To prepare a dictation test, proceed as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Options</strong> panel as described in the <a href="#options">Changing Options</a> section above.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Dictation</strong> mode option.</li>
<li>If you are taking dictation in a language that uses accents, but you don't want to have to enter these accents, then leave the <strong>Require accents</strong> check box clear. Otherwise, tick it and you will be required to enter characters accurately, using any method available on your device. For example, in Windows you can hold down the Alt key whilst entering the code for the character.</li>
<li>To begin with, you may want to leave the <strong>Hide text</strong> check box clear, so that you can refer to the text if you get stuck. As you become more proficient, or if you find it distracting to have the text displayed, you can tick the check box. Then, text only appears in the book container when you have correctly typed it.</li>
<li>For details on other options available during dictation, see <a href="#generaluse">General Use</a> below.
</ol>
<p>To start the test:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start</strong> button beneath the book container(s).</li>
<li>Listen to the text as it is spoken, and start typing what you hear in the input box situated above the <strong>Start</strong> button. You don't have to capitalise letters or include punctuation. If necessary, you can make the input box larger by pressing and dragging its bottom-right corner.</li>
<li>If you make a mistake, the text turns red and you are prevented from entering any more characters until you correct the mistake. If your second attempt is also incorrect, the word is repeated. On the third incorrect attempt, the word is spelt out.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reading/Following Spoken Text</h2>
<p>To read and follow spoken text, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Options</strong> panel as described in the <a href="#options">Changing Options</a> section above.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Reading</strong> mode option.</li>
<li>By default, the block of text currently being read is highlighted in the book container. If you don't want this, clear the <strong>Highlight</strong> check box.</p>
<li>For further details on options during reading, see <a href="#generaluse">General Use</a> below.</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Start</strong> button to begin the reading.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="generaluse">General Use</h2>
<h3>Pausing</h3>
<p>To pause speaking, press the <strong>Pause</strong> button. The button changes to a <strong>Resume</strong> button, which you can press to restart the speaking. During a pause, you cannot access the text input box during a dictation exercise. However, you can change the start position, so speaking will resume from the new position.</p>
<h3>Repeating</h3>
<p>To hear the last unit of text again, press the <strong>Repeat</strong> button. If the text is currently being spoken, it is interrupted and restarted from the beginning.</p>
<h3>Changing the Start Position</h3>
<p>To change the start position for reading or dictation, click on the place in the text, scrolling if necessary. To start from this position with a newly-opened book, press the <strong>Start</strong> button. To start after pressing the <strong>Pause</strong> button, press the <strong>Resume</strong>button; pressing the <strong>Start</strong> button will cause it to start from the beginning of the text, not the clicked position. You can also change the position whilst text is being spoken: speaking will continue immediately from the clicked position. This is particularly useful with bilingual texts whose sentences don't always tally.</p> 
<h3>Changing How Text Advances</h3>
<p>Select the appropriate <strong>Speak</strong> option for how you want the text to advance: by word, by phrase, or by sentence. Or if you want dictation that alternates between a text and its translation, select the <strong>Bilingual</strong> option.</p>
<h3>Changing Voices</h3>
<p>From the <strong>Voice</strong> drop down lists, choose the voice you want used for the book, and if this is a Bilingual test, for the second book. You can change a voice whilst the application is speaking, but it won't take effect until the current block has been read out.</p>
